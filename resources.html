                                <p>With Coding Dojo’s Self-paced Python Bootcamp, you can learn one of the most popular
                                    programming languages for web development on your own schedule. The course also
                                    covers technologies such as Ajax, MySQL, Flask, jQuery,
                                    and APIs. You won’t be completely alone because you have the option of requesting
                                    one-on-one conversations with your instructor, who can provide useful feedback on
