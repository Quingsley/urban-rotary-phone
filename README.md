## About the site
> So this site I just decided to share my expericence throughout my development both as a computer science student and as I learn to be a software developer. I have shared some of the projects done and my experienc in the tech community so far 
I have also shared some of the resources that one requires to use so as to get started in their development career. Also on the site on can find useful people that are already in the tech community who can provide good guidance for one to be a good software developer.
