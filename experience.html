          My Development
          <span class="text-muted">How I Joined Computer Science</span>
        </h2>
        <div class="container">
          <p class="text-white col-md-11">
            Computer Science is a field that i think came to me by a whisker.
            Before joining the University I was enthusiatic about doing this
            well paying course after graduation like medicine and in the
            engineering field. However I was not lucky to even get a chance to
            join the prestigious universities. People gave advice to choose any
            other course that will be of benefit to my life but at that moment I
            was worried that i am of no use. So what I did was I justed picked a
            course in the medical field for the sake of doing it <br />When I
            was at home during the lockdown period, we started online classes
            even before enrolling physically to the university. I was always
            busy with my phone so I was on the school website and realised that
            they offered other programs with an online organization. I was
            intruged byh it so i decided to give it a try. I jioned the
            organization and only found one course that was being offered for
            free since the others were being paid for. It was
            <em class="lead">Programming for everybody in python</em> <br />
            This was a turning point in my life after undertaking the course. My
            mindset changed and I told my parents that after enrolling I am
            going to do facalty transfer and change my course to
            <strong>Computer Science</strong><br />This came to be true and I
            have never had doubts in the choice I made
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-white text-center p-2 m-1">Coding Experience</h2>
         
          <p class="text-white col-md-11">
            Coding at first is a great feeling just like when a small baby
            starts walking.The feeling of when you write, run and compile your
            first <em class="lead text-warning">'Hello world'</em> program with
            success cannot be described. For me I first started with Python
            programming which was very easy at first but after joining the
            Computer Science community I was advised to start with the low level
            programming language <strong>C Programming.</strong> I found it fun
            as it laid a good foundation in my Coding experience. Furthermore,
            research has it that most of the current programming languages were
            invented from C and I tell you learning C is like learning most
            programming languages since the syntax is almost similar to that of
            C. I then move up to Learning <strong>C++</strong> which is a
            superset of C. The main reason of learning this language was to
            introduce one to the concept of
            <em>Object Oriented Programming</em> which forms the basis of real
            world applications.After learning this two languages I found it
            easier to be introduce to other programming languages.
          </p>
          <h3>What about Web Development ?</h3>
          <p class="text-white col-md-11">
            Some of you might be wondering why I am talking all fo this
            information instead of talking about web development.Don't worry I
            have got you covered! Web development is currently what live with
            day and night. I started this journey with a quench of thirst of
            building websites for people but the journey has not been a linear
            progress. You must first know how the internet works and a bit of
            its history. After knowing this then you are supposed to learn HTML5
            which is responsible for the markup or content of the webpages.
            After learning the basics you can move on to CSS which is
            responsible for the styling and presentation of webpages. To have
            more fun one has to learn Javascript which enables interactivity
            with end users in websites. For now this is the journey that one has
            to take in order to have the asic skills of web developmet. After
            this is when one can decide a clear of which they can take on their
            career in web development by either becoming a front end developer,
            back end developer or a fully fleged fullstack developer.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-white text-center p-2 m-1">The Ups and Down</h2>
          <p class="text-white col-md-11">
            Everybody knows that progress is never a striaght line graph or is
            it ?Challenges are a part of our lives that we cannot hide from
            them. We must encounter them and we should always be ready to tackle
            them. This journey has not been easy. They have been stubling blocks
            but I try to keep going. We clearly know that technology is evolving
            at a very fast speed and we have to keep up with them. Everyday
            there is always a new technolgy that arises and one must be able to
            learn it to keep up with the markjet demand which is currently
            competitive. Another challenge is that the career paths are quite
            many and every organization tries to make and advertise on in
            choosing their path. There are many career paths in Cmputer Science
            and one should be able to learn almost all of them to become
            marketable in the future because you cannot stick to only one path,
            what if that path fails ? So when choosing your path in CS be think
            clearly on what you want to do and do a research to see if it be of
            added value to your yourself
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-white text-center p-2 m-1">What keeps me Going ?</h2>
          <p class="text-white col-md-11">
            As we live in a digital age, most industries rely on data and
            software programmes. Computer Science & IT impacts everything, from
            scientific research to health development, transport, banking,
            communications, you name it. Even objects like microwave ovens,
            fridges, or door locks are now connected to our Wi-Fi networks and
            personal assistants. Technology has made the world better, faster,
            and more connected. But this didn’t happen by magic. We arrived here
            thanks to the brilliant minds of IT graduates, who took their
            passion for technology and used it to create gadgets and computer
            programmes which help us every single day. You can be one of the
            people who work on innovations that will take humanity forward. The
            questions you should keep asking yourself
